# release-notes-generation-tool
The tool aims to collect, process, and analyze data from various Bug Tracking Systems. The outcomes by this processed data are easily readable reports in various formats, like AsciiDoc, and PDF files, that contain release notes and issue trackers based on detected bugs. The platform can generate these reports automatically, on-demand by the actor, or even when an event is triggered and detected by the platform.
